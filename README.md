# Weather App

This project was created to showcase my ability to call an API asynchronously with error handling and manage its response data.


## Installation

Navigate to the folder in your terminal and run

```bash
  npm install
```

Then run

```bash
  npm run dev
```

To get the project setup and running locally.
